# Implementation of 3 heuristics to solve TSP
## Author : Jean Maccou

Each heuristic can be run by it's own file, the file point2D is a help to implements data visualisation and is mandatory to run the solver.
The CSV files are instances of the problem randomly generated.

#### Optimisation :

Simulated annealing : Very good results

Genetic algorithm : Acceptable results

Ant colony : Bad results, need to be reworked
